This is a first outline of the Wizard Sequencer, the ultimate tool
for creating the workflows of dialogs in any particular order.

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<p><u><h2>Introduction</h2></u>

It was designed with the aim of simplicity in defining the workflows
and easiness in changing and rearranging the workflows. It should
also manage all needed tasks for the workflow process, such as
implementing the flow of the user through the whole workflow.

<p>
The basic idea was to be able to specify the sequence of dialogs
some way and let the Sequencer do all the rest. Like handling that
on this next that dialog will be called on some condition, or
when the user press back, again the right dialog is recalled.
